# A Ncurses Client for Rue RSS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/himmAllRight/curse-rue.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/himmAllRight/curse-rue)

This will be the location for a python-based, ncurses client to connect to a
[rue-rss](https://github.com/himmAllRight/rue-rss) server.

Very much a work in progress at this point. Deciding on the options and how to do the ncurses
windows/panels.
